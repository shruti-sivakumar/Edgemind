# <0.005 cores) have a tiny rolling std, so a trivial periodic bump yields a huge
# z-score → false cpu_spike (the recurring false positive). Conversely a real
# flood only pushes opc-ua-collector ~2x (0.011→0.0225 cores), which against its
# naturally noisy baseline (std ~0.005) gives z~1.4 — well below any z threshold.
