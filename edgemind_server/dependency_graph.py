"""
dependency_graph.py — auto-discovers pod dependency topology from K8s metadata.

Reads Service and Endpoint objects from pump-station namespace.
Builds a directed graph: pod A → pod B if A's service endpoints include B.

Also encodes the known pipeline topology from the design doc as a fallback
in case the K8s discovery doesn't capture all edges (e.g. OPC-UA traffic
doesn't go through K8s Services).
